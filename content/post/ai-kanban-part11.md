## Tasked with improving Tasks

The final phase of our plan is focused on visual cleanup and better error handling. Before I focused on the visual cleanup I wanted to fill in some of the gaps that exist in our plan. I'm starting with Tasks. There are several missing features that I wanted to add to Tasks to make them more useful. This post includes those changes.

### Rounding out Tasks

At this time Tasks only have a title, description, and their position in the column. This really is not enough for a serious Kanban application. I asked Claude to add the following fields:

- **Type**: valid values are Work and Defect
- **Priority**: valid values are Low, Medium, High, and Critical
- **Identifier**: autogenerated field based on the type (W or D) and a sequential number based on the number of that type of tasks on the board.

Visually I wanted a clean look. This is the final result:

I'm happy with this result so I'm moving on to the next addition to Tasks.

### Adding task history

I wanted the system to automatically keep track of changes to tasks. I wasn't necessarily worried about tracking changes to the values but was hoping to track changes to the task state. I decided to only track task creation and when a task is moved from one column of the board to another. I might add more tracking in the future but for now this is sufficient.

For the interface I decided to place the history on the popup where you edit a task. Here is what it looks like:

### Adding task comments

Finally I wanted users to be able to add comments to a task. I asked Claude to add a comments field and a comments section to the Task edit screen. Here is what it created:

## One more thing

For this session I am finished making update to Tasks. There was one more thing I wanted to do but first of all I wanted to do a tool update.

### Claude inside Tidewave

It was announced that one can now run [Claude Code directly inside of Tidewave](https://tidewave.ai/blog/claude-code-codex). This sounded amazing and I had to give it a try. It was totally seamless to set it up and away I go. There was one thing that I found annoying so I decided to use my new setup to address.

### Creating a link to my boards

When A users logs into the system they are directed to their boards. But if they leave that page there is no way for them to get back except to type the url in the browser. I asked Tidewave (or is it Claude?) to create a link on the top of the pages to always take a user to a list of their boards. One minute later it existed as did the French translation.

## More cleanup to come

There is some more cleanup I plan to do before moving on to Task 7. Stay tuned for more fun.
