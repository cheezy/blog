## I'm back

It has been a while since I've blogged. I had a blog named CheezyWorld.com
for many years but stopped posting many years ago due to life. I am super
excited to get back to sharing what I've been up to. Here are some of the topics I'll explore.

### AI

Lately I have been spending my nights and weekends diving into AI. This is a topic that makes a lot of developers nervous as they fear it will replace them or they fear that it will produce low quality code that they will have to support. Through this blog I hope to explore how we can leverage AI to produce high quality code.  

### Continuous Delivery

I'm still spending most of my day hours helping companies learn how to deploy
their software to production many times per day while keeping the quality high. This is my passion and I will have a lot to say on this blog about it.

### In closing

That is all I have to say for this first post. Expect more to come soon.
