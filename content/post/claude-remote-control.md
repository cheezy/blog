Anthropic is in the process of releasing a feature for Claude Code that I think is amazing. It is [Claude Remote Control](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/remote-control). This feature allows you to control your Claude Code session remotely from any iOS or Android device.

I can see this feature being used in many different scenarios. For example, you could use it to check on work while you are in a meeting, to kick off a task while you're at lunch with friends, or to simply sit on the couch and oversee some work Claude is doing. I used it to get a few tasks completed while having coffee with my son. It was extremely easy to use and I can tell you I will be using it a lot. I personally tested it on both my iPhone and iPad and it works great.

In order to make this work you need to start a Claude remote-control session on your computer. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

<video width="80%" controls>
    <source src="/img/iTermClaudeRemoteControl.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

This will start a remote-control session on your computer. Pressing the space bar will generate a QR code that you can scan with your phone or tablet to connect to the session.

On your mobile device, you will find the remote session by accessing the code tab in the Claude app.

From there you should be able to access the remote session.

<video width="60%" controls>
    <source src="/img/iPhoneClaudeRemoteControl.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

This was running on my desktop at home. I was simply controlling it remotely. AMAZING!

The feature is currently in preview and is only available in Max and Pro plans at the time of this writing. Give it a try.
