## WIP Limits

Before we start building out the columns I asked Claude to update the plan in order to add WIP limits. I was suprised by the number of changes that were required. You can see the details here in the first video of this post.

## Adding the columns

Now on to adding columns to our Kanban application. In the first video we ask Claude to finish all of the non-UI work which includes adding a column table to the database, create the relationship to board, create the schema to hold the data from the database, create the context to perform the basic CRUD functions, and finally create the tests for all of this.
