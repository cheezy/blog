## Taking a Detour

I decided to change the plan a little and take care of a couple of user facing issues. Let's see how that goes.

So we have a new plan. I will be making the site pretty (and responsive) and I will be adding internationalization including the French language support for all existing pages. Should I trust Claude to come up with my design? What should I expect out of an LLM? Let's see the results of the first part of this revised plan.

And the final step in this post is to add multi-language support and the French translation. The language selector that Claude created is too simple for me to add additional languages in the future but I'll address that in time.

At this point we have a site that has a complete authentication system, a beautiful design that is responsive, and internationalization with French and English. Not bad for spending _about an hour_ on it.
