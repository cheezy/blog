## Taking a Detour

I decided to change the plan a little and take care of a couple of user facing issues. Let's see how that goes.

So we have a new plan. I will be making the site pretty (and responsive) and I will be adding internationalization including the French language support for all existing pages. Should I trust Claude to come up with my design? What should I expect out of an LLM? Let's see the results of the first part of this revised plan.

And the final step in this post is to add multi-language support and the French translation. The switches is too simple for me to add additional languages in the future but I'll address that in time.
