## Using Claude Code to write the Authentication Code

In Part 3 of this series we are finally ready to allow Claude Code to wite some code. We have our system configured properly, we have created a plan to take small steps, and now it is time to get started. I will be using Claude Code to build the Authentication for our Kanban Board application. There are a few times where I had to ask Claude to do something different. It is always important to pay attention. After the video was complete It took the time to verify everything and look at the code. Everything was good as I expected.
