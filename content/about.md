## About Me

Hello, I'm Jeff "Cheezy" Morgan and yes Cheezy is a nickname given to me a long time ago. I have worked with development teams and leadership for over 30 years. This blog is where I share ideas and experiences I have working with modern tools, exploring AI and machine learning, and rapid delivery techniques while delivering software for my clients and building my own applications.
