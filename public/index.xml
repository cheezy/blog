      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About Me&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Jeff &amp;ldquo;Cheezy&amp;rdquo; Morgan and yes Cheezy is a nickname given to me a long time ago. I have worked with development teams and leadership for over 30 years. This blog is where I share ideas and experiences I have working with modern tools, exploring AI and machine learning, and rapid delivery techniques while delivering software for my clients and building my own applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-back&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve blogged. I had a blog named CheezyWorld.com&#xA;for many years but stopped posting more than 12 years ago. At the time I was traveling for work as well as traveling around the world to speak at conferences. My life circumstances are different now and I am happy to return to blogging. I am doing (and have been doing) a lot of exciting work and have a lot to share.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
