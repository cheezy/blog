      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-a-tdd-guy&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a TDD guy&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been writing code using Test Driven Development for about 25 years. I am a huge believer in the benefits of this practice. I have spoken about it at conferences around the world and have taught many workshops on the subject. As I started to dig into AI the first thing I tried to do is see how it would fit into my TDD workflow. I tried numerous approaches and they all felt unnatural. I watched videos of others try to do the same and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like they were successful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
