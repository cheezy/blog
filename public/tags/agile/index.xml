      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I will be using Stride and Claude Code to add a &lt;em&gt;Resources&lt;/em&gt; section to the Stride UI. Through a series of videos you will see me go through the entire lifecycle of adding this feature to Stride.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;brainstorming-with-claude&#34;&gt;Brainstorming with Claude&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I start with a concept. I want to add a new section to Stride where users can go to find answers to questions about Stride. I hope to include a lot of images and videos. The video below shows the output of a Brainstorming session I had with Claude. The session lasted about 5 minutes. I would expect a Product Owner and Developer to pair on this activity in a team setting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my pursuit of trying to get the most out of my AI Agents I have spent a lot of time exploring how one can deliver requirements in such a way that they can be understood by Humans and provide the details that will make the Agent implementation successful. Knowing that there is typically a pause between when the requirements is established / captured and when the Agent starts working on it, I wanted to make sure that much of the context and details the Agent had during the planning session was captured in a way that it can be use later during implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Does Programming Language Matter?</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-ai-work-better-with-some-languages-than-others&#34;&gt;Does AI work better with some languages than others?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of developers identify with the language they program in. How often do you hear &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a Java developer&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a Python developer&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had several conversations with other developers about this topic. Some believe that certain languages are better suited for AI-assisted development than others. Others think that the choice of language has little to no impact on the outcome. I&amp;rsquo;m of the opinion that language does matter but this is just based on my personal experience that is limited to three languages (Java, TypeScript, and Elixir) in four different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adopting AI Driven Development</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;sharing-what-worked&#34;&gt;Sharing what worked&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have often wondered why some companies have had great success adopting AI for software development while others have had the opposite experience. Some people talk about AI &amp;ldquo;Slop&amp;rdquo; meaning very bad code written by AI. At the same time many of us see AI producing code that is high quality, well factored, and well tested. Is it possible that the way one approaches this technology has an impact on the outcome?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;stride-now-supports-four-ai-assistants-with-always-active-guidance&#34;&gt;Stride Now Supports Four AI Assistants with Always-Active Guidance&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What a day. Earlier today I rolled out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stridelikeaboss.com/blog/stride-has-skills&#34;&gt;Claude Code Skills for Stride&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of hours later I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that Stride now supports four popular AI coding assistants beyond Claude Code, with always-active instruction files that help developers avoid common mistakes and follow best practices when working with the Stride API.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenge-supporting-multiple-ai-assistants&#34;&gt;The Challenge: Supporting Multiple AI Assistants&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know that not all developers use Claude Code. Many companies are invested in tools like Copilot, Windsurf, etc. Developers in these companies should not feel left out when it comes to Stride. Because of that need, I have just added enhanced instructions for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/features/copilot&#34;&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cursor.com/&#34;&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.windsurfrules.com/&#34;&gt;Windsurf Cascade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://continue.dev/&#34;&gt;Continue.dev&lt;/a&gt;. These assistants are excellent tools, but they needed help understanding Stride&amp;rsquo;s workflow requirements, especially around:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am excited to announce a major enhancement to Stride&amp;rsquo;s AI agent workflow: &lt;strong&gt;Claude Code Skills&lt;/strong&gt;. These skills enforce best practices and prevent common mistakes that waste hours of development time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-claude-code-skills&#34;&gt;What Are Claude Code Skills?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Claude Code Skills are specialized instructions that guide AI agents through complex workflows. Think of them as expert advisors that activate at critical decision points, ensuring agents follow established patterns and avoid known pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-humans-collaborate-with-ai&#34;&gt;How do Humans collaborate with AI?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I decided to make &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stridelikeaboss.com&#34;&gt;Stride&lt;/a&gt; a Human-AI collaboration tool I spent some time thinking about when and how Humans would want to interject themselves into an AI driven worflow. Those of you that know me know that I have spent a significant portion of my life helping teams optimize their work and achieve better flow. With AI in the mix it causes us to rethink some of what helps us achieve that flow. We have to be realistic about what Humans do best (at this time) and what AI does best and find a way to optimize around these things. At the same time, many Humans are not comfortable (at this time) with letting AI take over completely and they want to be involved in the process. This is what I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-an-ai-optimized-kanban-system-a-human-ai-collaboration-experiment&#34;&gt;Building an AI-Optimized Kanban System: A Human-AI Collaboration Experiment&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m embarking on an experiment to build a Kanban task management system specifically designed for AI-human collaboration. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just another project management tool—it&amp;rsquo;s a system where AI agents and humans work together as peers on software development tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-vision&#34;&gt;The Vision&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most task management tools treat tasks as simple items with a title and description. But when you&amp;rsquo;re working with AI agents (like Claude, GPT-4, or custom agents), they need much more context to be effective. They need to understand:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;bringing-ai-into-your-organization&#34;&gt;Bringing AI into your organization&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have now worked with multiple teams that have introduced an AI driven development into their development workflow and I have seen a pattern emerge. When AI, and more specifically Vibe Coding, is introduced into a traditional software development organization that are following an Agile process there are three tensions that quickly arise. All three of these tensions are due to the rapid pace of development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Agile compatible with AI?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have made my living as an Agile coach since 2003. I have worked as a coach for clients around the world, taught many courses in various topics, and spoken at too many conferences to count. I have dedicated more than a third of my life to these concepts and truly believe they have been the best way to deliver software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Agile has gone through many changes over my career. A few of the major ones that I feel have had the most impact are the introduction of Lean Startup, practices like BDD and Acceptance Test Driven Development, and my favourite which is Continuous Delivery. Most of these changes have come from within the Agile community and have pushed us forward in our understanding of how to deliver more value quicker. I have stayed current and in some cases have been on the forefront for many of these changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
