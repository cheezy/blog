      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the first post in a series in which I will be building a Kanban board application with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.phoenixframework.org&#34;&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html&#34;&gt;LiveView&lt;/a&gt;. What is different about this series is that I will use AI to write the code and tests as well as come up with the design of the application.  I will be using a set of tools and workflow that I have worked out over the past several months to truly take advantage of the benefits of AI while producing quality code and a fully tested application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-back&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve blogged. I had a blog named CheezyWorld.com&#xA;for many years but stopped posting more than 12 years ago. At the time I was traveling for work as well as traveling around the world to speak at conferences. My life circumstances are different now and I am happy to return to blogging. I am doing (and have been doing) a lot of exciting work and have a lot to share.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
