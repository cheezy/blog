            <h1>How Much Should I Spend?</h1>

            
                <p>This post will explore the question &ldquo;How much money should one spend on AI tools?&rdquo;. We will be looking at this question from multiple perspectives, the developer who wants to learn AI at home, the developer who works solo and wants the tools in order to boost their throughput and quality, and also from a corporate perspective. I&rsquo;ll give pricing that is available on the websites but larger discounts are often available for annual subscriptions or educational institutions. All prices are in Canadian Dollars.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-landscape">The Current Landscape</h2>
<p>Before we dive into specific recommendations, let&rsquo;s acknowledge that the AI tooling landscape is evolving rapidly. Prices change, new tools emerge, and existing tools add capabilities. What I share here is based on my experience as of early 2026.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are options at every price point. The challenge is understanding what you get at each level and whether the investment makes sense for your situation.</p>
<h2 id="the-home-learner">The Home Learner</h2>
<p>If you are a developer who wants to learn how to leverage AI for development at home, you have several options. The first question to ask yourself is &ldquo;What do I want to learn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you simply want to understand what AI can do and get a feel for the technology, you can start with free tiers. Claude, ChatGPT, and others offer free access with limitations. You can copy and paste code into these tools and ask questions. This is a fine way to start but it will not give you a true sense of what is possible when AI is integrated into your development workflow.</p>
<p>To really understand the potential, you need to use tools that are integrated into your IDE or terminal. Here are some options:</p>
<h3 id="free-or-very-low-cost-options">Free or Very Low Cost Options</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>GitHub Copilot Free Tier</strong> - GitHub now offers a free tier with limited completions per month. This is a good starting point for code completion.</li>
<li><strong>Codeium</strong> - Offers a generous free tier for individuals with code completion and chat.</li>
<li><strong>Continue</strong> - An open-source option that can connect to various models including local ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>These options will give you a taste of AI-driven development but they have significant limitations.</p>
<h3 id="the-sweet-spot-for-learning">The Sweet Spot for Learning</h3>
<p>If you are serious about learning, I recommend spending $20-30 per month. This gets you access to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claude Pro</strong> ($28/month) - Access to Claude&rsquo;s most capable models with generous usage limits</li>
<li><strong>ChatGPT Plus</strong> ($25/month) - Access to GPT-4 and other advanced features</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> ($14/month) - Solid code completion integrated into your IDE</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not need all of these. Pick one to start. My recommendation would be Claude Pro because it gives you access to Claude Code which is - in my opinion - the most capable AI coding agent available today.</p>
<h3 id="my-recommendation-for-home-learners">My Recommendation for Home Learners</h3>
<p>Start with Claude Pro at $28/month. Spend time learning how to work effectively with the AI. Read documentation, watch videos, and experiment. Learn about MCPs, Skills, and SubAgents and configure the tool to your workflow and development environment. After a month or two, you will know if this is something you want to continue investing in. The cost of a few cups of coffee per week is a small price to pay for learning a technology that is transforming our industry.</p>
<h2 id="the-solo-developer">The Solo Developer</h2>
<p>If you are a solo developer or freelancer looking to boost your productivity, the calculus changes. Now we are talking about return on investment. The question is not &ldquo;Can I afford this?&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;How much more can I accomplish with these tools?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="the-math">The Math</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do some simple math. If you bill $100 per hour and AI tools help you complete work 50% faster, you either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earn the same amount while working fewer hours, or</li>
<li>Earn 50% more by taking on additional work</li>
</ul>
<p>At 160 hours per month, a 50% improvement is worth $8,000 in additional capacity. Even a conservative 10% improvement is worth $1,600 per month. Compared to that, $100-250 per month for AI tools is negligible.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-recommend">What I Recommend</h3>
<p>For solo developers who want maximum productivity:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Claude Code with API credits</strong> ($100-250/month depending on usage) - The Pro plan at $28/month is a starting point but heavy users will want to use API credits for unlimited access to the most capable models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Windsurf Pro</strong> ($16.95/month) - If you prefer a more IDE-integrated experience, Windsurf is excellent. It combines a VS Code-based editor with deep AI integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Both</strong> - Many developers use Claude Code for complex tasks and Windsurf for in-editor assistance. The combination works well.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-solo-developer-sweet-spot">The Solo Developer Sweet Spot</h3>
<p>I would budget $100-250 per month for AI tools as a solo developer. This gives you access to the best tools without artificial limitations. If you find yourself hitting usage limits frequently, increase your budget. The ROI is almost certainly positive.</p>
<h2 id="the-corporate-perspective">The Corporate Perspective</h2>
<p>Corporate adoption of AI tools is different. There are considerations beyond just productivity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security and data privacy</li>
<li>Compliance requirements</li>
<li>Licensing and legal concerns</li>
<li>Training and onboarding costs</li>
<li>Standardization across teams</li>
</ul>
<p>I cannot go into each of these topics in detail here. Instead, I will focus on cost savings from moving to AI-driven development and what you pay to achieve those savings.</p>
<h3 id="expected-savings">Expected Savings</h3>
<p>Adding AI-driven development to your development teams can have significant impact on your bottom line. It will result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster development cycles</li>
<li>Reduced debugging time</li>
<li>Fewer bugs in production</li>
<li>Ability to take on more projects</li>
<li>Higher quality deliverables</li>
</ul>
<p>Most organizations expect to see these types of savings but are they the only savings to come out of this shift? Let&rsquo;s look at the unexpected savings.</p>
<h3 id="unexpected-savings">Unexpected Savings</h3>
<p>I think there are three areas of savings that are typically not factored in when the overall cost of AI is calculated.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In most corporate settings there is a fairly large testing organization that takes the output of development and verifies its correctness. As AI agents start writing more of the code, the quality of the code goes up and the automated tests being written alongside that code also improve. Over time the need for the testing organization goes down dramatically as the issues they find drop. I have worked directly with teams where it was expected to find at least a couple of defects each week and once we introduced AI agents the number of defects dropped to very close to zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the teams ramp up with AI-driven development it becomes very clear that the old way of gathering requirements is unable to keep up with the rate of change. This is not a problem that can be solved by having more people work on it. This can only be solved by leveraging AI to brainstorm changes and create tasks that can be delivered to the development team. Heavyweight processes will need to be replaced by processes that are much more fluid and adaptive. This results in a much faster time to market and a much lower cost of change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In much the same way as the requirements process needs to be streamlined, other activities around the development process need to go through the same scrutiny. Our deployment pipelines need to become simpler and much faster. Our legal review processes need to be re-evaluated to truly understand what needs to be reviewed and what can be automated. Our audit requirements should be questioned in this new world and we should find new faster ways to meet our compliance requirements. A lot of tools you have purchased to facilitate large numbers of people working together will become obsolete (Jira, etc). The list of areas that will be impacted can go on but I will stop here for now.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-much-should-you-spend">How Much Should You Spend?</h3>
<p>All of the savings I mentioned in the two previous sections are extremely hard to quantify. For my recommendations I will look at something else. Let&rsquo;s look at a couple of very simple images to help us understand the basis of what we are talking about. Let&rsquo;s assume that one developer can produce one jellybean each week. You very likely have a good idea of how much that developer costs you per week so I am sure you can perform a simple calculation to know how much you paid for that jellybean.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/img/one-developer-cost.png" alt="Cost for one developer">

</p>
<p>What if that developer could produce two, three, or even four jellybeans each week? What would you be willing to pay to achieve that level of productivity?</p>
<p>
  <img src="/img/one-developer-with-ai.png" alt="Cost increase for one developer with AI">

</p>
<p>This is the real question we need to be asking.</p>
<h3 id="the-minimum-viable-investment">The Minimum Viable Investment</h3>
<p>For a company exploring AI-driven development, I recommend starting with a small pilot as I described in my <a href="/post/adopting-ai-driven-development/">previous post on adopting AI-driven development</a>. Budget for:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tool licenses</strong> - $150 for Claude Enterprise and $30 for Windsurf Pro per developer per month for the pilot group</li>
<li><strong>Training time</strong> - Expect 1-2 weeks of reduced productivity as developers learn</li>
<li><strong>Guidance files</strong> - Time to create and refine your AGENTS.md, appropriate Claude Skills, and Subagents or similar configuration. Ideally you would have these ready before you launch your pilot team.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="scaling-up">Scaling Up</h3>
<p>Once you have validated the approach with a pilot team, the question becomes how to scale. At this point, companies typically negotiate enterprise agreements. Prices vary significantly based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of seats</li>
<li>Security requirements</li>
<li>Support levels</li>
<li>Contract length</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect to pay $75-150 per developer per month at scale for basic tools, with additional costs for more capable models and higher usage limits.</p>
<h3 id="the-hidden-costs">The Hidden Costs</h3>
<p>What many companies underestimate is the cost of doing AI poorly. If you try to save money by using free or cheap tools, you may end up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers frustrated by limitations</li>
<li>Lower quality output requiring more review</li>
<li>Security risks from tools that do not meet compliance requirements</li>
<li>Lost productivity from tools that are not capable enough</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between a $10/month tool and a $100/month tool can be enormous in terms of capability. Do not be penny wise and pound foolish.</p>
<h3 id="my-corporate-recommendation">My Corporate Recommendation</h3>
<p>Budget $100-150 per developer per month for AI tools. This ensures access to capable tools without artificial limitations. More importantly, invest in:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Training</strong> - Help developers learn to use the tools effectively</li>
<li><strong>Guidance</strong> - Create and maintain good AGENTS files and standards</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong> - Adapt your development process to take advantage of AI capabilities</li>
</ol>
<p>The tools themselves are the smallest part of the investment. The bigger investment is in people and process.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The answer to &ldquo;How much should I spend?&rdquo; depends entirely on your situation:</p>
<table>

          <th>Monthly Budget</th>
          <th>Recommendation</th>

      <tr>
          <td>Corporate pilot</td>
          <td>$150-200/developer</td>
          <td>Premium tools with proper training</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Corporate scale</td>
          <td>$75-150/developer</td>
          <td>Enterprise agreements + investment in process</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The most important thing to understand is that the cost of AI tools is trivial compared to the value they provide. A developer who is dramatically more productive provides value worth thousands of dollars per month. Spending $100-150 to achieve that is an obvious investment.</p>
<p>What you cannot afford is to ignore this technology or to use tools that are so limited they do not demonstrate what is possible. Either approach will leave you behind as the industry continues to evolve.</p>
